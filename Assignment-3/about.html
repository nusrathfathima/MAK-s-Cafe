                <p>
                    All-around interest of our team in different geographies has helped
                    us develop unique flavors and tastes which we will bring to you at
                    MAK's Cafe. Street food vendors in India have local knowledge of
                    indigenous herbs and spices which they use artfully to prepare rich
                    and flavorful dishes. Our team has a deep understanding of the
                    variety of spices, and we use them wisely to create food that will
                    leave an impression on your taste buds for a long time. We are
                    experts in regional delicacy with a combined cooking experience of
                    over 50 years. Some of our people started cooking at home, and bring
                    the authentic and original taste to each dish they prepare, while
                    others are trained chefs that have explored and mastered the skills.
                    We truly believe in the statement – “You must cook with your heart".
                    In our Tandoor – our traditional clay oven – we prepare a variety of
                    hot savory dishes from fluffy naan to tikkas and kababs, and we get
                    it just right each and every time. When you are playing with
                    delicate dough and fiery tandoor, the timing is critical and our
                    team has mastered this critical skill.
